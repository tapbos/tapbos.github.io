  What is TAP?
</h2>

TAP stands for <a href="http://tap.tacl.org/" target="_blank">Taiwanese American Professionals</a>, and is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization through its parent organization, <a href="http://tacl.org/" target="_blank">Taiwanese American Citizens League</a>.

### What is the typical age range?

Our events generally attract young professionals in their 20’s and 30’s, ranging from folks who have just graduated college to those in their mid-career, but we welcome anyone of any age!

### What language is generally spoken at TAP events?

We are English-speaking. If you are more comfortable in environments where Mandarin Chinese is the main language spoken, we are more than happy to connect you with organizations that provide these settings.

### How do I become a member?

We do not have formal membership &#8211; you should simply come out to events! You can join our mailing list and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/555884057764564/" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> to get the latest TAP news, or follow us on social media for realtime updates.

### Do I have to be Taiwanese to be in TAP?

Of course not! Having an interest in Taiwanese/Taiwanese America is one thing attendees and volunteers may have in common, but we welcome all identities, races, ethnicities, and political beliefs.

### Is TAP a political organization?

No, we are a politically neutral organization favoring neither the pan-blue or pan-green political coalitions in Taiwan. We respect all mainstream political viewpoints in Taiwan and encourage open discussion on all things related to Taiwan. Our official stance on Taiwan is that we believe in self-determination and the furthering of democracy.

### How is TAP different from other Asian American organizations in the Boston area?

In addition to having a focus on Taiwanese/Taiwanese American culture, one of TAP’s unique qualities is that it is part of a national network of TAP chapters. We also try to foster a strong sense of family and camaraderie in our community &#8211; come to an event and see for yourself!

### How do I get more involved?

Come to an event and say hi! Don’t be shy &#8211; feel free to email us at <hello@tap-boston.org> and we’ll be sure to connect with you.
