    Dear TAP Boston,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Happy New Year!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It&#8217;s hard to believe that we&#8217;re celebrating TAP Boston&#8217;s 6th birthday this year! Six years ago TAP Boston was founded to build a community and developing leaders to serve Greater Boston. With the support over the years from all of you, we&#8217;ve accomplished much so far including:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Hosting a National TACL Convention in Boston featuring speakers like Michelle Wu, Tommy Chang, Simon Hedlin, and Dr. HoChie Tsai
    </li>
    <li>
      Matching 100+ college students and 75+ mentors over four years in the EDGE mentorship program
    </li>
    <li>
      Partnering with 10+ non-profit organizations to dedicate over 700+ hours of community service collectively
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    As we kick off 2018, I&#8217;d also like to share what&#8217;s in store for the new year. The core objective of many TAP events is to foster meaningful connections and relationships among members, whether it&#8217;s in the form of a TAPpy Hour, kickball game, or the summer BBQ. Through our professional development arm, community service events, and our EDGE mentorship program, we hope to provide a forum where you can grow in multiple dimensions and serve the Greater Boston area.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In short, TAP really has a singular purpose: to serve our members, you! To help us achieve that this year, we would like to ask you to:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b><a href="http://www.tap-boston.org/events/">Continue attending our events</a></b> &#8211; meet the people who might be your next best friend or help you a new job, and serve the community while you&#8217;re at it!
    </li>
    <li>
      <b><a href="http://www.tap-boston.org/about/team/">Get involved</a></b> &#8211; chat with a board member to see how you can get involved; it&#8217;s a lot of fun!
    </li>
    <li>
      <b><a href="mailto:info@tap-boston.org">Tell us how to improve</a></b> &#8211; we want to hear your ideas for the next event, or how we can get better!
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    We are so proud to be part of such a vibrant community, and we can&#8217;t wait to embark on adventures with you in 2018!
  </p>
  
  <p>
