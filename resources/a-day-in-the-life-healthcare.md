<h2><strong>Week in the Life: Pain Fellow</strong></h2>
I am currently an interventional pain fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital here in Boston. I completed my anesthesiology training at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in NYC and my medical school at the University of Virginia. I was also fortunate enough to have worked in engineering as well as finance. Due to my broad background, I am able to also provide insight on changing professions and even changing specialties within a profession.

The job itself is a subspecialty within anesthesiology. Anesthesiology focuses on the critical peri-operative care of the surgical patient. This includes MAC (monitored anesthesia care which is primarily sedation), general anesthesia (this is when the patient breathes in anesthetic gases that keeps them asleep through a device that maintains the airway), neuraxial anesthesia (the “spinal tap” and epidurals which are typically used for pregnant patients) and regional anesthesia (which uses ultrasound to guide blockade of specific nerves).

Interventional pain however, is quite different from the parent specialty. It focuses on the medical management and interventional management of patients with pain. Beyond the normal prescribing of pills, interventional pain management doctors do injections all along the spine, in muscles, joints and surrounding nerves. In addition, we also implant spinal cord stimulators as well as pumps that infuse medications directly into the spinal fluid.

<h3><strong>Monday </strong><strong>(Anesthesia)</strong></h3>

| -------------:|:------------- |
| 6:30am |  Arrive at the hospital to set up my room for the first case of the day. This involves getting proper airway equipment in the room, have my medications drawn up in syringes and checking the anesthesia drug delivery machine. |
| 7:00am |  Meet my patient (often for the first time), evaluate them and develop an anesthetic plan (choosing one of the aforementioned types: MAC vs General etc.). Place an intravenous line and sometimes an intra-arterial line prior to proceeding to the operating room (OR). |
| 7:20am |  Proceed to the OR for induction of anesthesia. This can be as easy as having them breathe spontaneously to something as complicated as using a fiberoptic scope to intubate them while they are awake. |
| <nobr>7:30 – 9:30am</nobr> |  Maintain hemodynamic (blood pressure and heart rate) as well as respiratory parameters (oxygenation and expired carbon dioxide) at the appropriate physiological levels while keeping an even plane of anesthesia. As anesthesiologists we are responsible for protecting the patient during the surgery. From the padding of pressure points to dealing with liters of blood loss. |
| 9:30am |  Await the induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient. |
| 10:00am |  Average time for a lot of cases is around 1-2 hours so at this point the patient would have any reversible medications are reversed and the anesthetic is appropriately turned off prior to having the airway device removed. Afterwards they are taken to the recovery room. |
| 12:00pm |  Usually time to grab a quick bite after being relieved by a colleague or in between cases. |
| 12:00 – 4:00pm |  Continue cases until being relieved around 4:00PM if you’re not on call. If on call, this time can vary. |

<h3><strong>Wednesday </strong><strong>(Pain OR)</strong></h3>

| -------------:|:------------- |
| 8:00am |  Arrive in the hospital to round on patients prior to going to OR for cases for the day. |
| 9:00am |  Meet our patient (who we have met either as an inpatient or in clinic), mark the surgical site and complete the consent for the indicated procedure (such as an intrathecal pump implant). |
| 10:00am |  Position the patient appropriately for the procedure at hand (on their side for a pump implant) and then prep and drape them in a sterile fashion. |
| <nobr>10:20 – 12:00pm</nobr> |  Begin the procedure, making an incision in the abdomen to create a pocket for the pump that we are implanting. We also use live x-ray to determine the appropriate levels to thread the catheter above the spine within the spinal fluid. After appropriate placement of the catheter, we are able to close both incision sites and the patient is woken up from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room. |
| 12:30 – 3:00pm |  Repeat the whole process with another patient (meet, induction of anesthesia, procedure, recovery room) |
| 3:00 – 4:00pm |  Another procedure or possibly fielding consults from other services concerning pain management for patient. |

<h3><strong>Friday </strong><strong>(Pain Clinic)</strong></h3>

| -------------:|:------------- |
| 7:00am |  Arrive in pain clinic for didactics. A lecture is usually given on relevant topics in pain by a fellow or attending. |
| 8:00am |  See first patient either as an initial or follow-up. |
| 8:30am |  Do a procedure in the x-ray suite (nerve blocks, nerve burning, spine injections, etc.) or procedure room (ultrasound blocks, trigger point injections, botox injections, etc.). |
| 8:30 – 12:00pm |  Repeat either procedure vs initial vs follow-up every 30min to 45min. |
| <nobr>12:00 – 12:30pm</nobr> |  LUNCH! |
| 12:30 – 4:00pm |  Repeat procedures vs initial vs follow-up. |

Anesthesia and pain are things that I have really grown to enjoy. As an anesthesiologist I like being the so-called “protector” of the patient that cares for the patient in every aspect while they are undergoing surgery. Although we are often unsung heroes, at the end of the day if I’m able to make a difference in even one life, I can go home happy. The other benefit is that even in the training phases you have a very reasonable schedule that allows you to do other things that you enjoy.

The life of a pain doc is quite different because you have a patient base that you follow-up with on a regular basis. This is a far cry from the life of an anesthesiologist who oftentimes meets a patient on the day of surgery and never sees them again. Ironically this dichotomy exists within one field of medicine. The nice thing about pain is that you can have patients and you can see them over a period of time and take care of them. It’s also nice because it is procedure oriented allowing you to do both simple injections, complex medication management and implants.
