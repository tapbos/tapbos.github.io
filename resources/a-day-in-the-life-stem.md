<h2 id="Systems-Engineer"><strong>Day in the Life: Systems Engineer</strong></h2>
I work as a Systems Engineer at a defense contractor. A Systems Engineer focuses on the designing the overall architecture of a complex product, and tests the product to ensure that it is working as intended. Communication and systems thinking (thinking big picture, how things are interrelated) are the two major skills needed in this kind of environment. Programming skills are definitely a huge plus.

[ezcol_1fifth]8:00 – 9:00am[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Wake up (maybe hit the snooze button a couple of times) and do morning stuff. Get out of the door by 8:45 and drive to work.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]9:00 – 10:00am[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Eat breakfast at work. Catch up with coworkers. Read emails. Check in with team lead to learn about any news and to see if I’m aligned with current priorities. Answer questions or resolve issues that teammates may have been running into.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]10:00 – 11:30am[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Dive into my own work, which could include coding tools, running simulations and analyzing results, documenting test results, and discussing with other teams regarding bugs that our team has found.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]11:30 – 12:00pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Lunch time (I get really hungry…). Used to sit down at the cafeteria and eat with some coworkers, but lately I have been eating at my desk and continuing work.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]12:00 – 6:00pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Continue to do the work described above. A lot of times, the team lead or teammates will stop by my desk for questions. I may stop by and catch up with coworkers in other teams to see how they’re doing. I’ve recently been asked to help out with a second project, so I may take a few hours to do some work there.

I have found communication with other teams to be key. One, you establish a network. You get to know people on a more personal level, enhancing your working relationship. Two, you understand what the other teams’ needs are, and perhaps help find ways to help resolve them. It also helps expand your perspective on the project rather than just being concerned about your immediate tasks.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]6:00 – 7:00pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Depending on how I’m feeling, I’ll leave somewhere around this time. Wrap up what I’ve been working on. Send some emails that I hadn’t had a chance to respond to yet.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]7:00 – 8:30pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end] Make some dinner, relax for a bit. Catch up on news.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]8:30 – 2:00am[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Since I’m in school part-time, the rest of the night is spent working on homework until I get too sleepy.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]
<h3><strong>What I like about my job:</strong></h3>
There are lots of different projects, which provide lots of opportunities to work on something new.

The people. Working with a diverse group of people helps you learn from different perspectives. I also enjoy a collaborative environment.

I have been given many opportunities to continue to grow. Most recently, I was nominated to a Leadership Development Program. Also, I was asked to help a Chief Engineer on another project part-time.

The company is flexible in their work arrangements and most team leads allow you to adjust your work schedule as necessary.
<h3><strong>What I don’t like about my job:</strong></h3>
As a contractor, you’re limited to the work defined in the contract. It makes it difficult sometimes to pitch something innovative if it doesn’t fall under the work outlined in the contract.

Lots of middle management. So many people spend a lot of time creating PowerPoint charts to report status to managers they need to report to.

Lots of inefficiencies. Some teams’ responsibilities are extremely trivial and don’t provide much value. Those responsibilities could be consolidated to other teams.

Some projects are supporting legacy products and use older technologies. It’s not as cutting-edge as I would like (doesn’t have the same cutting-edge feel like a Google or a Facebook).
<h3><strong>General Thoughts:</strong></h3>
Keep learning. If you’re not in a position where you are learning, you need to do something about it. Ask for work where you have to learn something new, change projects, change jobs.

Learn how to make an impact at your job. Don’t just work on the immediate tasks that are assigned to you. Figure out the work that needs to be done, but no one has thought about yet.

As stated earlier, talk to other people. Effective communication is everything at a work place.

<h2 id="Chief-Technology-Officer"><strong>Day in the Life: Chief Technology Officer</strong></h2>
I am a Chief Technology Officer and co-founder at a company that teaches kids to take care of their chronic conditions through engaging mobile games. We use games as a platform to teach certain educational goals regarding a condition such as asthma. We are at seed stage currently with 3 full time employees and 2 contractors. Prior to becoming CTO, I was the Art Director / Software Engineer here, but one of our co-founders left for military service in Taiwan, so I took over his role.

For those not familiar with the position name, a CTO leads the development/tech side of a company. My main responsibilities are to make sure the assets from the artists and the developers come together and are integrated nicely in the project code under a tight schedule, so a lot of prioritizing and figuring out which method is most efficient. Aside from managing I also work on the codebase in the game. CTOs and CEOs in a startup typically work together to figure out project timelines and technology feasibility for a company.

I have a computer science degree from Tufts University, and worked for a dropbox-like company as a Software Security Engineer / Developer in the bay area.

[ezcol_1fifth]8:50am[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Wake up, get dressed, eat breakfast and get out. My commute is brutal so the earlier I can get out the door the better.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]9:40am[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Get on the T, I try to start my day now by responding to emails and assigning tasks to my team for the day. Some days I end up reading the news or playing games on my phone, so it all depends on how I am feeling at that moment.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]10:30am[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Arrive at work and briefly go over goals of what you plan to accomplish for the day with your team. Since I manage two other people, I ask how their tasks are going and if they need any help with them. It sometimes takes a while before I really settle down to do work depending on how busy the company is in general.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]11:00am[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Start doing some development tasks that needs to be done. Usually i try to tackle the more tedious ones first, so I have the whole day to work on it if it takes longer than expected.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]12:30pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Lunch break - Typically eat out at a local cafe with the team. If we bring our own lunches, we just surf the web while we do or just have a casual chat about something interesting.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]1:20pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Back to doing our tasks. Again I check up on how others are doing, it’s important for me to be on the same pages as other people to ensure all the moving parts come together smoothly.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]3:00pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Stretcher, this is usually the time when our food coma/mid-day slump usually kicks in. Because of such we usually plan our meetings during this time so we can stand up and do something refreshing. We time our meetings to make sure we stick to our agenda and not waste any time. If there are no meetings in place we spend about thirty minutes to play some board games or card games just to change the pace.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]3:30 – 4:00pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Back to work, this is the last stretch and also the time a lot of emails start pouring in. I usually set time in between tasks to look at some of the emails, but I usually don’t let it distract me.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]6:00 ~ 7:30pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]I end my day depending on if there are events that I need to attend after work. I usually make sure I finish the tasks I am working on since it is hard to get back into a chunk of code that you leave unfinished the next day.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]7:00 ~ 9:00pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]I get home around this time if there are no events going on. I try to cook something for dinner and just relax. Most of the time I end up doing some work for my side projects.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]12:00 ~ 1:00am[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]I go to sleep around this time, its very important for me to have enough sleep or else I will take a hit mentally the next day.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]
<h3><strong>What I like about my job:</strong></h3>
My daily job is meaningful to me. Although there are definitely occasions when I wake up not wanting to go to work, most of the time I start thinking about how I am going to tackle the day’s problems on the subway. As a developer, I'm glad that I can do most of my tasks without much waiting on other people (which can get really frustrating). As a co-founder your company's potential value is as much work as you put into it (as well as other factors of course), so I feel the drive to keep needing to working on it. I really want this company to succeed.
<h3><strong>What I don’t like about my job:</strong></h3>
The commute is a killer in my already-packed schedule. I lose about two hours commuting every day, taking that long in the morning affects your mental clarity when you get to work. I try to be efficient as possible doing some administrative tasks when I am on the subway, but that takes a lot of willpower and discipline. Having to manage people also affects my tasks. I often get distracted during work because people have questions only I can answer. It takes time for me to get into the zone again when it comes to coding, so the time you wasted trying to figure out where you left off can multiply. For software developers transitioning into manager roles, expect less time actually coding and more time answering emails/questions from others.
<h3><strong>General thoughts:</strong></h3>
Compared to CEOs in other startups, a CTO's schedule is generally more rigid since I don't need to attend meetings and conferences all the time. Although it is still busy, it’s crucial to get into a good sleeping cycle because nobody is really forcing you to get to work on time the next morning. There were times where I slip and come into work at 12pm simply because I slept too late the night before. You'll have more free time for other things in life but you have to be disciplined about your schedule.

Face-to-face time is incredibly valuable. I almost never work with contractors remotely because you can't see what they're doing/give immediate feedback and they take forever to respond to emails given last minute changes. Same goes with teammates, even if we are working on different tasks, having instant feedback saves lots of time compared to sitting around waiting for an email reply.

For developers, find out what your coding style is and work around that. Some people are the slow and steady type. I am personally the type that work in very short bursts, but I can't work for too long at a time or I will burn out. I work slightly less hours than my peers, but still get all the things I need done.

Being an entrepreneur is a lifestyle more so than an occupation for me. You're given very constrained resources/time and you'll have to figure out your own way to get through them - and still be sane afterwards. As said in the ‘Entrepreneur day in the life’, there are lots of "wantrepreneurs", but the difference is actually taking a leap of faith and getting your hands dirty, and I mean really dirty. Accept failures as opportunities for improvement and keep walking forward.

<h2 id="Research-Associate"><strong>A Day in the Life: Research Associate</strong></h2>
I work as a research associate at a small biotech start-up (currently 25 people) that’s 3 years old and still validating the potential application of its therapeutic platform. We develop oligonucleotides that target long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which bind to genes and recruit a repressor complex that decreases the expression of the bound gene.  My company targets lncRNAs that bind specific genes and inhibit their interaction with the repressor complex, which should increase the expression of the gene of interest.

We are still in pre-clinical development, and are currently testing the effectiveness of our platform for 3 genetic diseases.  Each project has a different team that meets once every two weeks, when different groups within the team will present their progress.  I work in the in vivo group, which means I deal mostly with animal dosing and tissue processing.  I mainly look at gene and protein expression levels in mice upon treatment with our oligos.  My company also has an in vitro group, which develops the oligo sequences and examines the effects of our oligos in cells, and a mechanism of action group, which studies how lncRNAs, genes, and proteins interact with our target gene.

[ezcol_1fifth]8:00am[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Wake up.  I’m out the door by 8:20-8:40 AM.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]8:40 – 9:00am[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Arrive at work.  Since it’s still way too early for me, the first thing I normally do is get coffee and eat a granola bar.  If there’s no meeting that day, I get started on experiments and usually am at the bench until noon.  Usually in mornings I process mouse tissues to RNA or prepare dosing solutions for our mouse studies.  On Tuesdays, we have a company meeting at 9-10:30 am to update everyone on the progress in a project.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]10:30 – 12:30pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]At this time, I may meet with my manager to discuss progress for each task and deadlines for the week.  On Wednesdays, we have donut time, where scientists have Dunkin Donuts in the lunch area to talk about any technical problems we’re having with experiments.  Upper management is not invited so we can talk freely.

Every other week, I attend a 2-3 hr project meeting where all the groups give in-depth presentations on recent data, and people brainstorm new experiments and problem solve together.  These project meetings go much more in-depth than the company meetings.  If there are no meetings, I’m still at the bench pipetting away![/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]12:30pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]I’m usually starving at this point because I don’t really eat breakfast.  I get Trader Joe’s frozen lunches across the street and eat with anyone who happens to be eating in the lunch area at that time.  Sometimes it’s a lonely lunch, but when there’s company, its fun![/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]1:00 – 3:00pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]I’m either back at the bench or at my computer analyzing data.  Generally in the afternoons if I’m at the bench I’m homogenizing tissues to process the next day, running RT reactions and qPCRs, or westerns.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]3:00pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]Tea time.  I’m fading at this point, so I also dip into my snack stash.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]3:00 – 6:00pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]I’m wrapping up my experiments for the day, or starting my data analysis if I have already run the assays.  I put all the data in presentation format before sending the raw and analyzed data to my manager.  Mistakes make everyone on the team really grumpy, so I double check everything obsessively.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]After 6pm[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]I usually leave work between 5-6pm and eat dinner at home.  Generally I don’t bring work home with me, so this is my time to do whatever.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]

[ezcol_1fifth]1am[/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_4fifth_end]I normally go to sleep around this time. I try to go to bed earlier though, since I’m always tired during the day.[/ezcol_4fifth_end]
<h3><strong>What I like about my job:</strong></h3>
My company is small and people are friendly, so I’m more invested in the company since I feel like I’m contributing more than I would in a bigger company.  Unlike research associates at big pharmas, I participate in experiments from start to finish instead of just doing one task over and over again, so my days are more varied.  I don’t know my co-workers well on a personal level, but it takes drama out of the job, and we don’t waste time talking during work hours. People are pretty efficient and responsive, and my manager is really clear about expectations and what needs to get done.  This is extremely helpful, since I always know what I’m supposed to be doing. I also like how stable my hours usually are, and that I don’t work from home.  I haven’t felt burnt out at work in this company yet, so I’m always ready to do things.

In academia, I was surrounded by a lot of young grad students and post-docs, and made much closer friendships and hung out with people outside of work.  Now I’m the youngest person at my company, and most people are married with young kids, or are very established (old) with grown kids.  While I miss having a more casual environment, I feel like I can learn a lot from my current co-workers and that they have the resources and experience to mentor me. I think I’ve gained a lot of perspective from them and feel much more guided and supported professionally.
<h3><strong>What I don’t like about my job:</strong></h3>
Mistakes cost a lot of time and money, and they generally happen on the technical side and can’t be fixed (it’s not just a number you can change on a spreadsheet).  I made a mistake once and it cost a couple days for the in vitro group to sort it out, so that really sucked and was pretty embarrassing.  As a result there’s a lot of pressure and it’s a bit stressful to run experiments.  You can really screw up the direction of the project if you do something incorrectly and don’t realize it, since the data may turn out different.  In academic research, my mistakes usually only slowed me down, not the people around me.

In pharma it’s common for restructuring to happen.  Bigger companies are notorious for laying off entire divisions with no warning, and smaller companies are extremely careful the people they have.  My company recently went through a restructuring and cut 3 people who were very good workers, which changed the dynamic considerably in a 25-person company. A lot of this happened because the leadership in the company changed recently.  It was probably a manager-employee fit issue, and that’s not something people always have control over.  So the instability of having a job in the industry scares some people.  Everyone gets great severance packages though.
<h3><strong>General thoughts:</strong></h3>
I’m really happy I made the move from academic research to industry research.  While I don’t have as much (or any) intellectual freedom in industry, I work shorter and more stable hours, and I generally feel that people are better communicators, projects move forward more quickly, and I’m given much more guidance.  There are a lot more meetings in industry research though, so it cuts up your day a lot.  If you have questions about the difference between academic and industry research, ask me!  I have pretty strong opinions on this.

Having a good manager makes a difference in how much I like my job.  My manager is willing to guide me and is protective of me, which makes me feel supported. To those looking for a lab, make sure the person you’re working for is someone who communicates well, has reasonable expectations of you, and doesn’t blame you for anything that goes wrong.  Everyone I know who likes their job has a good boss.

I know some people really need to love their job to be happy, but I’ve found that that’s not true for me.  I’m not in love with my job right now, but we work toward a noble cause, so it still feels like I’m doing something good.  I enjoy it and it pays the bills, and most importantly it gives me time and finances to do the things I want. For me, having this job means I get to hang out with friends and pursue other things, which makes me a lot happier and thus more productive.

<h2 id="Materials-Engineering-Graduate-Student"><strong>A Week in the Life: Materials Engineering Graduate Student</strong></h2>
I am a fifth year graduate student in materials engineering. Broadly speaking, I work on designing bio-inspired materials, specifically for flexible armor. Specifically, I have been studying the geometry and mechanics of joints found in our skulls, turtle shells, and seashells, how these geometries have evolved over time, and why certain geometries are better than others. My research involves three main components: experimental (making things with 3d printing and breaking them with machines), computational modeling (using the computer to pretend to break them), and analytical modeling (figuring out equations that describe how they break).

As a fifth year, I don’t have any more classes and I am finishing up my last experiments and writing my thesis. I have an advisor who is an administrator, and therefore doesn’t have much time for students. This means I get to set my own schedule and can essentially work on whatever interests me, but it also means I never get feedback and have to figure out things on my own.
<h3><strong>Thursday</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>What I like about my job:</strong></h3>
I like having full control of my time and schedule, and I really only work on things that I want to work on. It is challenging in many ways, both intellectually and not, and it is a safe environment to continually fail (most parts of most projects don’t work most of the time). I have full ownership over my project. I like making (and breaking) things. I went into the program knowing absolutely nothing about the field I am in now, and that was completely okay. Graduate school is a good place to change fields or directions.
<h3><strong>What I don’t like about my job:</strong></h3>
Having complete freedom is a double-edged sword. It’s hard for me to solicit feedback from my professors. Academia is painfully slow to me. I like getting things done, and often in academia things drag on and on and on (my advisor spent over a year “reading” my paper draft). Because graduate students need their own project, it can be isolating at times. I used to spend almost all my days at home when I was working heavily on simulations only to realize that I needed to work in the office just to see people.
<h3><strong>What this synopsis misses: </strong></h3>
There are some days when I do absolutely nothing, and some days when I’m working late into the night. Sometimes grad school involves really silly things since you have to do most things yourself. For example, every once in a while I have to carry this really heavy apparatus across campus to do my experiment. 3D printed materials come out of the printer with a layer of support material that needs to be removed, so I also spend a good amount of time cleaning 3D printed samples with a razor.
<h3><strong>The part of graduate school that no one talks about:</strong></h3>
I have to say everyone has a VERY different experience in graduate school that is largely influenced by your advisor, so if you are considering graduate school, think about what lifestyle and managing style you prefer and what your advisor is like.
