<h2 id="Asset-Management-Private-Equity"><strong>Week in the Life: Asset Management/Private Equity</strong></h2>
I am an Associate at a holding company for seven asset management firms. These firms, our portfolio companies, manage hundreds of billions of dollars for pension plans, universities, sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors. Each of our firms has specialties, such as small cap equities, real estate private equity, or even timber. They make money by charging fees to their clients (based on account size and performance). After operating expenses are paid (namely compensation related), the proceeds flow to us at the holding company. Our mission is to help our portfolio companies grow and to acquire new companies.

My job focuses on portfolio management, or the oversight of our existing companies. I am still new here (6 months in) and working on establishing myself both internally – with my colleagues – and externally – with the management teams of our portfolio companies. This job revolves around meetings and the prep involved beforehand. I have chosen to share three days during the week of December 15<sup>th</sup>, 2014. Monday is a busy day of meetings, Wednesday is a busy day of meeting prep and Friday is a relaxed day.

<h3><strong>Monday</strong></h3>

| -------------:|:------------- |
| 7:30am | Wake and make breakfast (bacon and eggs). Scramble to get dressed and pack a carry-on – I am traveling to attend a board meeting at one of our portfolio companies today. |
| 9:00am | Get into the office and begin preparing for the on-site visit. I print and review all the data related to the company (financials, investment performance, org charts, strategic plan) and make a list of questions. It is very important for me to be active in discussions with our portfolio companies and prove that I can add value. I should have been better prepared but didn’t want to spend too much time in the office during the weekend. |
| 11:00am | Pack up and leave for the airport. Get lunch at the terminal (bbq chicken salad). Meet my manager at the gate and chat about weekend before boarding the flight to Virginia. |
| 2:30pm | Arrive at the portfolio company’s offices – it’s in a very suburban office park. The head of my group also arrives and we catch up. |
| 3:00pm | The board meeting begins – this company has a larger board so there are 10 people around the table. Thankfully, this is one of the board meetings where I don’t have to take minutes so I can actually think and digest what people are saying. The company’s management team updates us on the quarter. They grew tremendously in 2014 so the conversation revolved around supporting the new scale of the business – things like new hires, compensation for top performers and office space needs. I get in two or three questions and am pleased with how the meeting goes. My manager is fairly vocal during the meeting (she needs to show that she can lead these), and I think she does a very good job. After the meeting concludes, we take a short break before the board dinner. |
| 5:00pm | Check in at the hotel and drop off my bags. Relax for 15 minutes before heading to dinner. |
| 6:00pm | Arrive at the club (the old man version...no dancing here) for dinner. I admit I am still a bit uneasy at these – there is usually a multi-generation gap between myself and the youngest board member, and it is tough to get beyond the usual small talk. You also become the butt of many “young person” jokes. But I make it through without getting put on the spot too many times and generally have a good time. |
| 8:30pm | Get back to hotel. Everyone is tired and we head back to our rooms. My manager and I have some additional meetings lined up in the morning, while our group head is on the first flight out. I hang out in my room for a bit before passing out around midnight. |

<h3><strong>Wednesday</strong></h3>

| -------------:|:------------- |
| 7:30am | Wake up with a smile after attending a fantastic TAP event at Shojo the night before (TAP events are that awesome). Cook breakfast (salmon filet) and get dressed. |
| 8:30am | Get into the office. This morning will be busy – we are helping one of our portfolio companies launch a new investment product, and my manager and I are preparing a memo and financial model to get our executive team up to speed. I had drafted both over the weekend and need to incorporate her changes to it. The way we work together on big deliverables is an iterative process – I send her a draft, she makes changes, I send her an updated version, she makes new changes and so on – until we have a finished product. I spend the morning updating the memo, which details the investment highlights, risks, competitive landscape, economics and execution plan for the new product. |
| 12:00pm | Grab lunch with a former coworker. |
| 1:00pm | I finish making my manager’s changes to the memo and shoot it to the portfolio company CEO for his comments. I relax for a bit, catching up on the news and chatting with coworkers. |
| 3:00pm | Attend a meeting with our CEO to discuss a strategic initiative at another portfolio company. This will be one of the largest initiatives in 2015, and although I am excited to be a part of it, my role here is more of a support person – mostly doing research and some project management. I don’t have much to say during the meeting. |
| 5:00pm | Get on the phone with the portfolio company CEO to discuss his changes to the memo. I send the updated version to my manager who is going to review it tonight. |
| 6:30pm | Head home for the day. |
| 7:00pm | Go to the gym. |
| 8:00pm | Cook dinner (ribeye steak and cauliflower). |
| 9:00pm | Shower and hang out at home. I am tired but can’t go to sleep until my manager sends out the memo to our executive team. I watch “Marco Polo” on Netflix, which is terrible. |
| 11:00pm | Email finally goes out and I pass out. |

<h3><strong>Friday</strong></h3>

| -------------:|:------------- |
| 7:45am | Wake up. Get dressed and out the door. |
| 8:30am | Head to one of our portfolio companies in Boston for a holiday brunch. Eat an omelet, mingle and head to the office. |
| 9:30am | It will be a quiet day – many people are already off on vacation, and the projects I am working on are each in a holding pattern (Christmas time and late summer are generally the slowest times for many firms). I reply to some emails but before long I am busy surfing the web, starting with the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Slickdeals, Longform, Facebook, Linkedin and Zillow. |
| 11:30am | Feeling very bored after exhausting my usual sites and friends to gchat with. Think about going to gym but glad I don’t, as my manager asks me to join a meeting. Enter a meeting with my group head, our CFO and the CEO of one of our portfolio companies, who proceed to engage in a heated debate/negotiation. Even though I have an opinion in the matter, I am not sure I can add value and don’t speak up. I politely listen and grab lunch in our cafeteria afterwards (it is burrito day). |
| 2:00pm | Trade some stocks and eat another burrito bowl. |
| 3:00pm | My manager leaves but my group head is still here and may ask me to run some numbers for him. |
| 3:50pm | My group head leaves. |
| 3:52pm | I leave. |

<h3><strong>What I like about my job:</strong></h3>
Room for growth – I find my job challenging and know I have a long way to develop before I can become a leader here (but see a path to it). I feel like I am learning and getting better. Lots of personal interaction – I like dealing with people and figuring out what makes people tick. Work/life balance – I generally know what days/weeks will be super busy (or not) and can plan accordingly.

<h3><strong>What I don’t like about my job:</strong></h3>
My role is fairly reactive, and there is less room, at least at my level, for creative thought and idea generation. It is a smaller firm and there are only a few people my age to hang out with.

<h3><strong>What this synopsis misses:</strong></h3>
Every month I have some tedious reporting work – analyzing the monthly financials and performance of our portfolio companies and summarizing it for the team. Our firm is fairly social and we have a lot of company outings/excuses to drink together.

<h2 id="Entrepreneur"><strong>Day in the Life: Entrepreneur</strong></h2>
I am working on a pre-seed startup idea – one that doesn’t have funding yet. It’s an online space that serves as a tool to help ambitious individuals collaborate and develop impactful ideas. The site is still in development.

I did investment consulting right out of college for a few years, went to business school, and worked on a friend’s startup that failed before founding the startup I’m working on now.

| -------------:|:------------- |
| 11:00am | Wake up and drink some water. I might eat a granola bar, but that’s about it. I usually don’t eat “breakfast” and go directly to lunch. I collect all the items I need to begin my day at a coffee shop or some open space at MIT or Harvard. |
| 12:00pm | Eat a quick lunch somewhere. I want to keep it to around $7 if I eat outside. Read up on news on the phone. Check emails on phone, but don’t respond to any. |
| 12:30pm | Find my coffee shop of the day and order a cortado. If I need wifi, I go to certain cafes. If I don’t want wifi, I go to other cafes. I write out my To Do list for the day and then get onto responding to emails. |
| 1:00pm | I’ve got a 30-45 minute call with somebody to give me some feedback on startup. I take notes. |
| 1:45pm | I reflect on the discussion we just had and compare it to the notes from my other calls to see if any patterns pop out. |
| 2:00pm | Got another call with somebody for more feedback. Take more notes. |
| 2:45pm | More reflection. I need to balance what people say they want with what I want. |
| 3:00pm | OK...so this is when I really start getting to work. I try to focus on doing 2-3 per day (my list usually has 10+ things I need to do). I have to write content for the site as somebody else is coding it. I spend a lot of time thinking about intricacies for the platform. I need to find the right way to brand and message the site. I think about many questions regarding how to market. Who’s the persona I’m building this for? What are the trigger situations? The more answers I put down, the more questions I come up with.<br/> I write. I sketch. I make visuals in PowerPoint. I make tables in Excel. I review mockups. Rinse and repeat this cycle. I have many versions of these things – it’s getting quite ridiculous and occasionally I need to clean up my folder.<br> I do admin stuff on a daily basis – like preparing an email list and also schedule more calls with people in the next few days.<br/> I have a list of “tough” questions that I go through almost everyday. I review my answers from yesterday to see if they still stand. I make adjustments if needed. |
| 6:30pm | Time for dinner. If I have leftovers, I go home to eat. If not, I’ll try to eat healthily, so I get a salad. Basically, try to stay away from carbs if I can. Sometimes, I feel like getting a cake. |
| 7:00pm | Eat dinner. Read more news. Respond to more emails. Just chill out for a bit. |
| 8:30pm | Go to the gym until 10:00 PM. |
| 10:15pm | Get back home, shower, and do the dishes and other random chores that need to get done around the apartment. |
| 11:00pm | I’m a night owl, so I usually work from 11 PM til about 3-4 AM. These are some of the most productive times for me as emails don’t come in. People aren’t online. It’s quiet outside. I continue the work I do from the afternoon as many of those items are long-term projects. Sometimes, I’ll talk with my buddy who’s working on his own startup in NYC to check in and just to lift each other’s spirits. Lots of uncertainty, but that’s the path we choose to take.<br/> Until the beta site is ready, a lot of what I do is just preparation for when that day arrives. I try to have in-depth conversations with 1-2 people per day. When the beta site is ready, I plan to talk to more and more strangers, but I’m only interested in talking to people I trust at this moment. |

<h3><strong>What I like about my job:</strong></h3>
It’s a challenge and rewarding. I set my own schedule and believe in what I’m doing. I get to apply things that I learned in school. I basically have a challenge that I need to figure out by myself. There is no “boss” with a laid out plan that I follow to “do well” or get promoted. A lot of room for me to be creative.

<h3><strong>What I don’t like about my job:</strong></h3>
Entrepreneurship is a lonely lifestyle, especially if you don’t have a full time team and are really early stage. You must be comfortable making decisions that don’t get immediate validation. You must learn to accept uncertainty and people dismissing what you’re doing – sometimes even your friends will dismiss it (you can see it in their faces even though they say “it’s a good idea”). Heck, you sometimes might think what you’re doing is stupid. It’s a rollercoaster ride as one day you think what you’re doing is great; other days...complete BS. You don’t make money if you’re bootstrapping and have no funding, so you can’t go out or spend like you use to. You have to make sacrifices in that regard.

I don’t think you are either born an “entrepreneur” or not. It’s something that you learn to become comfortable with. I often see it like this – if you see a problem, are you the type of person who will do something about it? Let somebody else do it? Or Let somebody else lead it and follow them? There’s no wrong answer and I think an individual can occupy all 3 buckets in different areas. Also, the primary job of an entrepreneur is to collect all the resources and assets that a company needs – this is probably the most challenging aspect.

I think there’s a big difference between an entrepreneur and a “wantrepreneur.” If you aren’t willing to suffer through the startup process and just want the end state, you’re the latter and I guarantee that you’ll flame out at the slightest challenge. But, that doesn’t mean you can’t be an entrepreneur down the line. I don’t think I’m a “legit” entrepreneur yet, but I’m getting there.

You can be an entrepreneur anytime in your life, so don’t worry if you aren’t one right after college. I actually think it’s good to work at a bigger company after graduation (I did for 3 years). Developing your network, learning how to deal with others, and learning from more experienced people are all very helpful.

<h3><strong>One final note</strong>:</h3>
If you have absolute conviction in your idea, I’d always encourage you to give it your all and seriously explore it. I don’t believe in “hedging” for big ideas – it works for smaller ideas (i.e. doing a startup on the side while you have a full-time job). You might fail, but you’ll learn and I promise that doors will open. If you don’t try, no doors will open...and that’s a 100% guarantee.

<h2 id="Private-Equity"><strong>Day in the Life: Private Equity</strong></h2>
Day in life... the ultimate exercise in generalization, but hopefully the paragraphs below can provide an honest and rudimentary view on the role of an investment professional.

I know this is cliché, but there are truly no typical days for me. There are certain tasks that are repeated or meetings that occur on a regular basis; however, these activities typically serve as benchmarks to continuous processes rather than routine tasks in repetition. Before I dive into my day, I think there’s some utility in explaining what I do first, which would shed light on why and what I do certain things later on.

I work at an investment firm, but what does that mean? We manage money (or more elegantly known as ‘funds’) on behalf of certain institutions, these typically include large endowments, pension funds, family offices, fund of funds, etc. These institutions are collectively called Limited Partners (LPs), and they pay us for a very simple reason – to generate returns on the money they gave us.

Our business model is very simple, we get paid a management fee, typically a percentage of the funds we manage, and take a portion of the profits we generate for our LPs. There are many such funds exist in the world today, and we differentiate by focusing on finding investment opportunities within the technology sector. We invest in private technology companies of all shapes and sizes, from two gals/guys in a garage (HotelTonight), to high-flying pre-IPO candidates (Groupon), to maturing software businesses (HighJump), we cover the entire growth spectrum within technology.

We have a group of 40 investment professionals in three offices with Boston being the mother ship, and each person has a major and minor on investment stage and sectors s/he is focused on. I primarily spend time in late stage opportunities (also known as private equity, or buyouts), and within the group I specialize in software businesses.

Being an investment professional, my sole purpose of existence is quite simple – I find investment opportunities for the fund, and when I’m doing my job right, I find good deals for our LPs. After spending close to three years doing what I’m doing now and six years in the broader money-shuffling ecosystem, I’ve come to several realizations for those interested in the career of alternative asset investing. There’s a difference between finding good deals vs. finding good companies but it’s a digression that I won’t cover here. In order to find good deals, you need to learn how to find deals first, and then set sail to finding a lot of deals. It’s similar to buying a house, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll buy the first house you see, instead the prudent thing to do would be to look at a lot (and I mean A LOT) of houses in the market, compare and contrast, and agonize with lots of sleepless nights before you pull the trigger on an actual purchase. There’s a lot of pattern recognition involved, the more opportunities you see, the better you will be at recognizing whether a deal is a good deal. Both from observing others in the industry and my own personal experience, in order to be successful in this game of house-flipping, one needs to be disciplined, opportunistic, strategic, and most importantly lucky. In the arena of luck, I share the same sentiment as Thomas Jefferson, the harder I work the luckier I find myself.

| -------------:|:------------- |
| <nobr>5:30 – 8:00am</nobr> | On work days, I generally wake up anytime between 5:30-6AM. I’m naturally an early riser, and I try to get at least six hours of sleep every night. Morning routines usually involve shower, light breakfast (coffee, smoothie or yogurt), and 30-45 minute of me-time, either gym, reading, or just visualizing the day ahead. My commute is simple, 15 minute walking on most days while listening to music or podcasts. |
| 8:00 –11:00am | I tend to keep early hours of the work day clear for several reasons. My best thinking is typically done in the morning, so I will usually work on things that require the most critical thought, working on financial models, reviewing diligence materials, coming up with new project ideas, and composing internal and external investment materials. During this time I will also quickly scan emails, and I follow the 3D-method (per GTD), do, delete or delegate. I will also try to catch-up on news particularly trade rags on new investments or acquisition that have been announced, and I will save interesting/longer articles to read later in the day. |
| 11:00 – 3:00pm | Middle of the day is typically where I start to hit the phones or emails aggressively. I’m usually on the phone talking to new companies that we’re trying to build relationship with, in the hopes of investing in them someday, or talking to companies I already know and getting updates from them. I would also have several in-person meetings during this time with prospects who might be in town or coffee with bankers who might have interesting deals for us. I’m not a big day-eater (which means I have larger than normal dinners, which is incredibly unhealthy I know), and I typically power through with salads, fruits or more caffeine. |
| 3:00 – 6:00pm | Typically this period is more of the same with meetings, phone calls or emails. I will also resume any unfinished readings from earlier in the day and catch-up on other tasks that may have come up. We’d also have internal meetings to discuss current projects and opportunities we’re chasing with more senior members of the team. |
| 6:00 – 8~11pm | On the days I’m in the office, I try to finish between 8:30-10PM. Usually evening times are reserved for low friction activities. I’d follow-up on emails, going through lists of companies that I’d like to get to know, brainstorm on conferences to attend and upcoming business trips. It’s also a good catch-all period for anything I didn’t finish during the day. I also use the time to prepare for meetings the following day, catch-up with co-workers, or grab dinner with friends. |
| &lt;12pm | Lights out before midnight almost always. |

<h3><strong>What’s not covered above:</strong></h3>
Tons... what I have outlined is an office day, when I’m physically at the office. I do travel quite a bit, much easier to build relationship with someone (think dating) when you’re in person. When I’m on the road, all bets are off and schedules are less my own so I’m generally in catch-up mode. I also work with a few of our portfolio companies quite extensively, assisting them in projects that are typically acquisition related and these activities ebb and flow depending on opportunities we see in the market. I work in a very self-directed environment, so there’s not a lot of micro-managing or supervision, but I do interact with the broader team quite often, getting feedback on the projects I’m working on and vice versa. On occasion when we’re in heavy due diligence mode, most of my day will be spent analyzing an investment target and going through litany of diligence materials, so a lot of the outbound efforts will take a backseat.

As I have referenced in the beginning, this is a quick snapshot of a profession where more capable individuals have written volumes, and some of my personal favorites include ‘Barbarians at the Gate’, ‘King of Capital’, and the ‘Masters of Private Equity and Venture Capital’. Happy reading and wish you more than luck.

<h2 id="Research-Associate"><strong>Day in the Life: Research Associate</strong></h2>
I am currently a Research Associate at Eaton Vance Investment Managers in Boston. I am a recent graduate from Boston College, where I studied Finance and Economics. I interned at the firm my junior summer and was fortunate enough to receive a returning offer for a full time position. Prior to my junior internship, I also interned at Grand Cathay Securities in Taipei as an Equity Research Intern and at Prudential Annuities in Connecticut as a Annuities Research Intern.

My role at the firm is to conduct macro-economic and political research on my coverage countries to assist the analysts and portfolio managers in their investment decision making process. I work in Eaton Vance’s Global Income team and the portfolio invests in international bonds, currencies, equities, and derivatives. My research contributes to the formation of investment ideas and the monitoring of the current investments. Overall, the portfolio seeks to generate alpha for investors through long and short positions in medium to long term trades.
<h3><strong>FIXED DAY to DAY</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>VARIABLE DAY to DAY 12:00-6:00 PM</strong></h3>
Conduct thematic research on economic trends, political systems, asset price movements for presentations and discussions. Better the analysts and portfolio managers’ understanding of a specific topic effectively to provide research value.

Host meetings with sell-side analysts and economists, participate in research conference calls, or seek out country experts to increase the team’s understanding of the coverage countries. Ask key questions to filter out market noises and find the key point that drives asset price movements.

Discuss economic and political events, analyze key events’ market implications, and discuss investment ideas at weekly meetings. Present thematic research findings at semi-annual department research retreats and monthly analyst meetings.

Attend investment conferences for panels, presentations, and discussions. Meet company representatives to gain insights on the industry, management, or country. Travel to meet government officials, think tanks, economic and political academics, and anyone who has insights on the coverage countries’ macroeconomics and politics.

I enjoy my work as a Research Associate. The company and role offers great exposure to the investment industry and challenges me to learn more about everything, quite honestly. The work is intellectually stimulating and allows me to further develop my investment philosophies, economic theories, and understanding of the world.

<h2 id="Corporate-Paralegal"><strong>Day in the Life: Corporate Paralegal</strong></h2>
Paralegal duties vary depending on which department (law) you work in and my job is to assist attorneys in all stages of corporate transactions and to make sure clients’ companies are running smoothly from a legal standpoint.

I am currently a corporate paralegal at a law firm in downtown Boston. I would like to say that I took my job because I wanted to gain more exposure in the field of law before attending law school but then again I think it really just happened that way. My original plan was to go directly into law school after graduating college but now I am glad I took time off to work. In the two years I took off, I not only gained more exposure in the legal field, I also got the opportunity to further assess my own goals and sharpen my interpersonal skills. Some people are well prepared for law school right out of college but I do not think I was one of them and so taking time off actually worked out in my favor.

Okay so here goes a random day in the life of a corporate paralegal…

| -------------:|:------------- |
| <nobr>6:00 – 8:00am</nobr> | Wake up and get ready for work. |
| 8:00 – 9:00am | Commute. |
| 9:00 – 10:00am | Arrive at office. Sign in. Create a new timesheet for the day. Get water and food from kitchen. Check/respond to emails and make a to do list on sticky note. Catch up with coworkers. |

| 12:00 – 2:00pm | Lunch is taken during this period, exact time depending on how much urgent work I have. We have department lunches every few weeks. Lunch break is an hour but some days I take shorter lunches because I want to get things done and other days I take a little longer when it’s not as busy and I’m eating out like at a restaurant or shopping. |
| 2:00 – 4:00pm | Follow up with clients on things they need to return and remind them of deadlines; research statutes; coordinate documents with outside legal counsel; walk over to the Secretary of State and or State House to file/obtain documents; research filing requirements in different jurisdictions; edit and revise documents. |
| 4:00 – 5:00pm | Prepare loan documents; summarize the necessary steps to get some company of our clients back into good standing; review to do list; ask coworkers about their life and get life advice from them; finish timesheet. |
| 5:00 – 10:00pm | Me time; when I was preparing for the LSAT/working on law school apps, this was mostly LSAT/law school app time; do some sort of workout; catch up with friends; watch some drama/shows; read; etc. |
| 10:00 – 11:00pm | Usually in bed by now; reading random things and doing other mindless activities;
