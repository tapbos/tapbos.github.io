Join us for the 2017 Reflection and Goal Setting Workshop! The workshop will be broken into two parts, (1)Reflections on 2016 and (2) goal planning 2017. We will be providing frameworks to thinking through both and there will be a group discussion aspect where there will be an opportunity to share experiences and achievements (sharing is optional!). At the end of this workshop, we expect that you will have some concrete goals and a plan to achieve them through incremental and measurable steps. 2017 will be a big year so start it off right! The building is the Continuum apartment complex and we will be using the common room on the 1st floor. The easiest way to get there is to walk around to the back and enter through the side door. There is free parking in the back and the side of the building.
