 TAP Boston dinner series is a great way to enjoy a good meal with a fun group of people, including two TAP board members, to learn more about our organization, and what events we have coming up. People who have not attended a dinner series event are especially encouraged to sign up! Your ticket will go towards shared plates and appetizers. There are only 8 available spaces so sign up soon to guarantee yourself a spot!
