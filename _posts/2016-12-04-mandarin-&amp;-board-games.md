We have reserved the private dining room in the club lounge of Millennium Place. When you arrive, please tell the front desk that you are visiting "Li-Chung from Unit 1506 in the Club Lounge". Your event fee includes non-alcoholic drinks and snacks. We will be eating hotpot for dinner after the event, so you can continue practicing your Mandarin then!
