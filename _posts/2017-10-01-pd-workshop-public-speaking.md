<p>The workshop will be focused on improving comfort and competence with public speaking. For the first half of the workshop, the focus will be on increasing comfort through playing improv games and learning the fundamentals of public speaking. For the second half, we'll be implementing the fundamentals by delivering mini speeches we create to each other. We'll also be giving each other direct feedback so you can know exactly what things you can improve on. The result is you'll leave feeling a bit more confident and knowledgeable about what you need to do to be a more successful public speaker.</p><p>Workshop space will be limited to 10 so that each attendee will have an opportunity to practice and get feedback, so please RSVP.</p><p>Also, for those of you interested in future PD events, please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUlq-YZcpLzhE4NJipPVq9bQaF2QSIOaH7tYvJ4XqAXisYXw/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUlq-YZcpLzhE4NJipPVq9bQaF2QSIOaH7tYvJ4XqAXisYXw/viewform">this quick survey</a> so we can get a sense of what type of events you're interested in! </p><div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;"><p><iframe src="//eventbrite.com/tickets-external?eid=38439668082&amp;ref=etckt" width="100%" height="275" frameborder="0" marginwidth="5" marginheight="5" scrolling="auto"></iframe></p><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 12px; padding: 10px 0 5px; margin: 2px; width: 100%; text-align: left;"><a class="powered-by-eb" style="color: #adb0b6; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powered by Eventbrite</a></div>
