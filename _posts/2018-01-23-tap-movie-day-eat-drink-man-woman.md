<p>Join us on what promises to be a chilly February day by warming up with us and watching Taiwanese director Ang Lee's meditation on life and love through those two classic motifs: family and food! From New York Magazine:<i>"The greatest chef in Taipei, Mr. Chu (Sihung Lung), still grieving over his long-dead wife, busies himself by cooking for his three grown daughters, who live at home. Working with the two screenwriters Hui Ling Wang and James Schamus, director Ang Lee (The Wedding Banquet) offers the routine yet mesmerizing anguish of love and romance and filial piety."</i>Attendance for movie nights goes fast, so please confirm your reservation through Eventbrite as well as an e-mail to <a href="mailto:anthony.yu@tap-boston.org">Anthony</a>!</p>
