Doing improv requires effective communication, listening and team work skills. We're going to be playing a series of beginner improv games that will help you practice these skills. No prior improv experience necessary, only a willingness to participate and have fun! Hope to see you there.<em>The building is the Continuum apartment complex and we will be using the common room on the 1st floor. The easiest way to get there is to walk around to the back and enter through the side door. There is free parking in the back and the side of the building. </em>
