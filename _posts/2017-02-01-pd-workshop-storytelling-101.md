Come to the TAP PD Storytelling workshop! We'll be teaching the basics of good storytelling, focusing on different aspects, such as movement, tone, expressions, and story structure. At the end of the session, you will be able to tell a beautiful, passionate story to the entire group! Storytelling is a critical skill, especially in your professional life. Sales teams and CEOs, for example, use storytelling as a tool to grow business, raise capital, impassion colleagues, and more. So come join us on February 26 and learn how you can develop your skills to become a better storyteller!
