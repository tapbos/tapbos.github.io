 This year, we are proud to join Ricesticks and Tea's Holiday Gift Drive again - the only Boston area food pantry program dedicated to serving the Boston low-income Asian community. We will be wrapping gifts at the TAPsgiving lunch to donate to low-income Asian families. We will be serving delicious catering from Chicken & Rice Guys, delectable holiday appetizers and desserts from board members. Get your early bird ticket before it ends November 14th! Proceeds will be donated to charity. Tremont On The Common is a short walk from the Park Street, Downtown Crossing, and Chinatown stops.
