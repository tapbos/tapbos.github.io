<b>TAP EDGE</b> provides a forum for college students to engage with successful young professionals in their field. Our goal is not to replace your university career center; rather, it is to offer the deep relationships and insider knowledge that they cannot otherwise have. A quality mentor is among the rarest and most valuable assets a college student can have. TAP is proud to help provide this for our community.
